                With Blue Tree Photography, I wanted to have a natural setting with each of my photos. 
                Incorporating 3 key color schemes from nature which are Green, Sky Blue, and Purple. 
                Photography is a way for me to release. 
                I feel like I am able to see the world in my own "micro" view.

            <p><!--paragraph about myself-->
                I'm an independent freelance photographer. 
                I have an interest in psychology/philosophy, stocks/Forex, software development, and martial arts. 
                My main focus are these 4 categories. 
                Over time, I plan to continue building upon these traits of mine in hopes to become the best I can be.
